        "This data comes from the ILO Modelled Estimates series. [The International Labour Organization (ILO)](#dod:ilo) combines countries' own reported estimates with statistically modeled estimates when observations are missing. This improves comparability across countries and over time and allows the ILO to calculate regional and global aggregates for every year. You can read more about how the ILO produces these estimates in the [Modelled Estimates documentation](https://ilostat.ilo.org/methods/concepts-and-definitions/ilo-modelled-estimates/).",
        "This data follows the standards of the [13th International Classification of Labour Statisticians (ICLS)](#dod:13-icls). Under this framework, employment includes work for pay or profit, including self-employment, as well as the production of goods for own use (such as subsistence farming). Changes in the definition of employment also affect who is counted as unemployed or outside the labor force. Because definitions were updated under the [19th ICLS](#dod:19-icls), data using the newer definitions is not fully comparable with data based on the 13th ICLS. You can read more about the definitions in [this explainer by the ILO](https://www.ilo.org/publications/quick-guide-understanding-impact-new-statistical-standards-ilostat)."
