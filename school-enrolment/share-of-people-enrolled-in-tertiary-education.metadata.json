        "The gross enrollment ratio counts all students enrolled at a specific education level, regardless of their age. This includes students who are younger or older than the official age range because they started school early, started late, or repeated grades.",
        "It measures enrollment at a given level by dividing the total number of students—of any age—by the size of the age group officially assigned to that level. For instance, primary enrollment counts everyone enrolled, even outside ages 6–11, but compares it only to the 6–11 population.",
        "Values can exceed 100% when students repeat grades or start late. For instance, primary school enrollment might include 12- or 13-year-olds who started late or repeated grades, pushing the ratio above 100%.",
        "A value of 100% does not guarantee that all children in the official age group are enrolled in school; some may be out of school entirely, but the ratio appears high due to older students being counted in the total.",
        "Values much lower than 100% indicate that many children of the official age are not enrolled at the expected education level - they may be out of school entirely, enrolled at a different level, or have never started school.",
        "Values much higher than 100% can indicate educational challenges such as high grade repetition rates, late school entry, or inefficient progression through the system.",
        "The data comes from administrative records such as school enrollment reports, combined with population estimates typically sourced from the United Nations or national statistical offices."
